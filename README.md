This is my Hilbert curve implementation in Unity. It produces a Hilbert curve in 3D, and renders a small demo out of it.
Rendering is done using GL draw lines.

Hilbert curve is a continuous, fractal space-filling curve, which visits each position of the space exactly once. Named after the German mathematician David Hilbert who first described it.
